Abstractâ€” The purpose of this study is to monitor electricity
consumption in dormitories, private rooms in hospitals, hostels
and such buildings where the users are provided with the basic
package that defines which electric appliances are allowed and
which high wattage appliances (e.g. electric heaters, electric rods,
hot plates) are not allowed to use. Efficient Energy Monitoring
revolves around the idea of Internet of Things, which deploys
smart monitoring concepts in existing electricity energy
consuming environments. The system monitors the real-time
electricity consumption of each individual room of a building,
showing users the complete statistical reports of their
consumption, notifying them if they are using any high wattage
appliance that crosses the threshold set by their administrative
authorities and do the predictive analysis to predict the future
electricity consumption and thus visualize the analytics. .
