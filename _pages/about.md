Hi, my name is Samia Kiran, a Computer Science graduate with great interest in developing light weight Deep Neural Networks. I am an AI enthusiast aspiring to translate the power of Artificial Intelligence to everyday activities. My passion is to apply my knowledge in tackling genuine issues like HealthCare.

I am currently a Master student in Computer Science at National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Pakistan. My thesis revolves around the idea of  ‘Pre-Impact Fall Detection’ in elderly using Deep Learning. I would be graduating in March 2023. 

Moreover, I am working remotely as a Python Scripter at [Odetta, Inc.](https://odetta.ai/), a US startup based in San Francisco, California (recognized by Forbes as [Top#25 Best Startup Employers in America, 2022](https://www.forbes.com/companies/odetta/?sh=3663bca36750). My core responsibilities include developing scripts in Python for automatically fetching different kinds of data from the websites across the globe.
