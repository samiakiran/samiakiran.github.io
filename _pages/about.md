Hi, my name is Samia Kiran, a Computer Science graduate with strong interest in developing light weight Deep Neural Networks. My goal as an AI enthusiast is to bring the benefits of artificial intelligence to everyday life. I am eager to use my knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems, particularly in the area of healthcare.

I have recently completed my Master's degree in Computer Science from National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Pakistan (ranked #1 in Engineering & Technology in Pakistan for the 8th consecutive year as per QS ranking 2024). The focus of my thesis was on Human Activity Recognition, specifically working on ‘Fall Detection and Prevention’ in elderly using wearable sensors & deep learning. 

I am currently working at [Bahria University Islamabad] (https://bahria.edu.pk/buic/cs/) as a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence, where I teach undergraduate AI students along with handling other administrative duties. Additionally, I am employed as a part-time Python Scripter (remote) at [Odetta, Inc.](https://odetta.ai/), a US-based startup located in San Francisco, California. My primary responsibilities include creating Python scripts to scrape various types of data from websites worldwide.
