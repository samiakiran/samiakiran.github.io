Hi, my name is Samia Kiran, a Computer Science graduate with strong interest in developing light weight Deep Neural Networks. My goal as an AI enthusiast is to bring the benefits of artificial intelligence to everyday life. I am eager to use my knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems, particularly in the area of healthcare.

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Pakistan. My thesis revolves around the idea of  ‘Fall Detection’ in elderly using Deep Learning. I would be graduating in March 2023. 

Moreover, I am employed as a remote Python Scripter at [Odetta, Inc.](https://odetta.ai/), a US-based startup located in San Francisco, California. My primary responsibilities include creating scripts in Python to automatically collect various types of data from websites worldwide.
